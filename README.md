# Emergency Vehicle Routing using Real-Time Network Communication ðŸš‘

## Project Overview

This project simulates *emergency vehicle routing* with *real-time network communication* using Python.  
It demonstrates how a control center server communicates with an emergency vehicle client, calculates optimal routes using Dijkstra's algorithm, and updates the route dynamically in response to traffic congestion.  
The system ensures that emergency vehicles receive the *fastest possible route* in real-time, simulating the role of modern smart city traffic management.
